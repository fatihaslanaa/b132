There are types of data type in Java
1) Primitive Data Types ==> byte < short < int < long â€¹ float < double ==>numaric primitive data tupes
boolean==> true or false char ==> for a single data
2)Non-Primitive dato types==> String ==> used for multiple different characters storage inside an object
String str = "Tom Hanks 123)?"
What are the differences between "Primitive Data Types" and "Non-Primitive Data Types"?
1)Primitive dato types have just volves but Non-Primitive Data Types have values and methods
2) Primitive Dato Types are created by Java, we cannot create a primitive data type
But we can create Non-Primitive dato tupes whenever we need
3) "Primitive data types uses lowercases in naming convention and Non-Primitive ones uses Upper case naming convention
4) USage of memory for primitive data types changes from data type to data type.
